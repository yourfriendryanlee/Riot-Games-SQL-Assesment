10) Magnitude Estimation
a how many people in your hometown own cars?

I live in Pasadena, CA. For this excercise, I am going to assume each individual lives in a household
(vs incarcerated). The population of Pasadena is approaching 145,000.
The average household in America holds 2.58 people. Therefore, there are 145,00/2.58 = 56,202 households in Pasadena.
There is also about 1 car for every two people in America.
Thus, the average household owns 1.3 cars, and if there are 56,202 households
in Pasadena, then there are 56,202*1.3 = 73062 vehicles in Pasadena.

b how many cheerios are in a box?

I would start my taking

c how many pizzas are delivered in Los Angeles each week?

There are 21 million people in the Los Angeles metro-politan area.
Let us assume that each person eats pizza once every 1.5 weeks.
In any given week, that means 14 million people ate pizza.
Let us assume that half of these people ordered their pizza instead of picking up.
That means that 7 million pizzas are delivered every week in the Greater Los Angeles Area.
